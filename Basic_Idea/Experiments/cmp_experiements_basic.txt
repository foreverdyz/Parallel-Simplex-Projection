The results of the basic idea experiments, the idea is parallel sort + parallel scan
foo1() is the serial algorithm, which includes quick sort + checking summations one by one.
foo2() includes the parallel merge sort from ThreadsX and prefix sum.
foo3() includes the parallel merge sort from ThreadsX and a new parallel scan method.
This file shows the comparing results between foo1() vs foo2() and foo1() vs foo3().
